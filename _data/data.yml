      - multiple product and marketing teams for targeting purposes. Techniques used: k-means, T-SNE and factor analysis.
      - Built 10+ gradient tree-based models to rank search results for different user segments and markets (95% coverage), which showed significant improvement in customer search success through A/B test.
      - Developed a customized ranking algorithm to assemble ranked lists from different models. Provisional patents filed and first-authorship papers published in KDD’19 and SIGIR’19. 
      - Proposed a hierarchical ranking model combining catboost and wide & deep neural network for use in matching and personalization.
      - Built an ETL pipeline that intake front-end business and back-end search logs (1M queries per day) using Spark.
